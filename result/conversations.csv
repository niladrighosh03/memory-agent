1,5,User (Express Concern),"I'm worried a low deductible will push my premium up too much — roughly how much extra would I pay for a ₹2,000 deductible versus ₹5,000?"
1,6,Agent (Logical),
1,7,User (Negotiate price),"If a ₹2,000 deductible raises my annual premium by about ₹2,000–₹4,000, can you negotiate a discount (aim for ~₹1,000–₹1,500 off) or include one add‑on (zero‑dep or roadside) so my cost stays close to the ₹5,000 option? Send the quotes via WhatsApp."
1,8,Agent (Emotional),
1,9,User (Express Concern),"I'm concerned the ₹2,000 deductible will push my premium too high — please try to negotiate a ~₹1,000–₹1,500 discount or include zero‑dep/roadside so the total stays close to the ₹5,000 option; send the quotes to my WhatsApp."
1,10,Agent (Personal),
1,11,User (Negotiate price),"I’m worried a ₹2,000 deductible will push my premium too high — please negotiate for a ~₹1,000–₹1,500 discount or include one add‑on (zero‑dep or roadside) so the total stays close to the ₹5,000 option, and send the revised quotes to my WhatsApp."
1,12,Agent (Default),
1,13,User (Express Concern),"I’m concerned the ₹2,000 deductible — which raises my premium by about ₹2,000–₹4,000 — will push my total well above my ₹5,000 target. Please negotiate a ~₹1,000–₹1,500 discount or include zero‑dep/roadside and send the revised quotes to my WhatsApp."
1,14,Agent (Personal),
1,15,User (Negotiate price),"Please negotiate with the insurer for a ₹1,000–₹1,500 discount or include either zero‑dep or roadside assistance so the final premium stays close to ₹5,000, and send the revised quotes to my WhatsApp."
1,16,Agent (Personal),
1,17,User (Express Concern),"I’m worried the ₹2,000 deductible — which seems to add about ₹2,000–₹4,000 to the premium — will push the total well above my ₹5,000 target. Please negotiate a ₹1,000–₹1,500 discount or include zero‑dep/roadside and send the revised quotes to my WhatsApp."

1,20,Agent (Personal),
1,21,User (Reject Offer),"Thanks — I can’t accept this as it’s over my ₹5,000 budget. Please don’t proceed unless you can get it down by ₹1,000–₹1,500 or include zero‑dep/roadside to keep it near ₹5,000."
1,22,Agent (Default),"Understood, have a good day."

2,2,Agent (Emotional),
2,3,User (Ask Coverage Details),"Sure — could you share the vehicle make, model, year, registration city and fuel type, plus engine CC/odometer and whether you want comprehensive or third‑party cover? Also tell me if you’re willing to take a moderate voluntary excess and which add‑ons (zero‑dep, roadside, engine protection) you want so I can send quotes via WhatsApp."

2,10,Agent (Logical),
2,11,User (Negotiate price),"Can you do better on price? Given my 20% NCB, 3 years claim‑free and willingness to take ₹3,000 voluntary excess, can you offer a discount — say around ₹1,500–2,000 off or any loyalty perk?"
2,12,Agent (Personal),
2,13,User (Express Concern),"I’m concerned that’s still above my budget — can you try to reduce the premium by about ₹1,500–2,000 or throw in a loyalty perk? I’m on a tight budget and will keep the ₹3,000 voluntary excess."
2,14,Agent (Credibility),
2,15,User (Negotiate price),"I’m on a tight budget — with my 20% NCB, 3 claim‑free years and ₹3,000 voluntary excess, can you cut the premium by ₹1,500–2,000 or add a loyalty perk (e.g., free 1‑yr add‑on/waived fees) to bring it within my budget?"
2,16,Agent (Default),
2,17,User (Express Concern),"I’m really concerned — even with 20% NCB, 3 claim‑free years and a ₹3,000 voluntary excess this is still over my budget; can you cut ₹1,500–2,000 or add a loyalty perk (like a free 1‑yr add‑on/waived fees)?"
2,18,Agent (Emotional),
2,19,User (Request additional info),"I can try—please share your current quoted premium (₹), vehicle make/model & year, registration city, which loyalty perk you prefer (free 1‑yr add‑on or waived fees), policy start date, and best WhatsApp number to send a revised quote."
2,20,Agent (Personal),"I completely understand — let’s see what I can do to get this within your budget.

I can try two approaches: reduce the premium by about ₹1,500–2,000 (subject to underwriting) or add a loyalty perk (common options: free 1‑yr add‑on like Roadside Assistance / Key Replacement / Zero Dep* or waive policy/processing fees). Zero‑dep is usually possible only for newer cars (vehicle age limits apply), while roadside/key assist are easier to add.

Please share these details so I can run a quick revised quote and message it to you on WhatsApp:
- Current quoted premium (₹)
- Vehicle make, model & year
- Registration city
- Which loyalty perk do you prefer — free 1‑yr add‑on (tell me which: Roadside Assistance, Key Replacement, Zero Dep) OR waived fees?
- Policy start date
- Best WhatsApp number to send the revised quote

Also tell me if any add‑ons are already included in the quote. I’ll review and get back with the best possible option."
2,21,User (Express Concern),"I’m really worried — even with 20% NCB, 3 claim‑free years and a ₹3,000 voluntary excess this premium is still over my budget; can you cut ₹1,500–2,000 or add a loyalty perk to bring it down?"
2,22,Agent (Personal),
2,23,User (Confirm Plan),"Got it — I’ll aim for a ₹1,500 premium reduction and run a revised quote. Please confirm your current quoted premium, vehicle make/model & year, registration city, policy start date and best WhatsApp number so I can send the update."
