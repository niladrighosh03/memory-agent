Watch common exclusions: wear-and‑tear or mechanical breakdown, non‑declared accessories, claims while driving under influence, and theft/key claims that require an FIR, invoices and supplier bills; zero‑depreciation applies only up to the insurer’s age limit (usually 3–5 years). To stay at ₹20,000 many Creta owners trim declared accessory cover or accept a small voluntary deductible—ICICI Lombard’s 9,000+ garage network and video inspection speed up settlements, but double‑check per‑event towing caps and annual RSA call limits in the policy schedule.",

Key exclusions: normal wear & tear, pre‑existing defects, lack of maintenance, racing/driving under influence, tyres/consumables and undeclared accessories; flood-related engine cover applies only if engine protection is active and vehicle was roadworthy. Most customers in your band choose a voluntary deductible of ₹1,000–₹5,000 (higher deductible lowers premium); shall I price this exact quote with a ₹1,000 or ₹5,000 voluntary deductible?",

Return‑to‑Invoice pays the difference between your IDV and the original invoice (including registration/tax) on total loss/theft, capped at the invoice amount per policy terms. Roadside Assistance usually offers 24/7 help with towing cover roughly ₹2,000–3,000 per rescue and on‑spot labour/fuel/key assistance around ₹500–1,000, though exact caps/wait times are set in the policy schedule.

After that window the concession can be withdrawn and rates may be rechecked, so it’s best to confirm within this period. For confidence, Aspire settled over 98% of motor claims last year and Royal Sundaram usually completes approvals within 7 days. Shall I bind the policy now to lock it in?",

Zero‑dep typically excludes consumables like tyres, batteries and routine wear‑and‑tear and applies to approved OEM parts; towing/emergency transport and roadside assistance in this package cover on‑site minor repairs, towing to the nearest garage and emergency transport. Insurers do set per‑claim and annual caps and occasional sub‑limits on labour/parts, plus any waiting periods — I’ll pull the exact ₹ limits and wording from your policy schedule and confirm them before we bind so you’re fully secure.",
